- Removed EntityRenderer and RenderGlobal and other such from Minecraft, replaced with NovaRenderer
- Instantiate the NovaRenderer instance
- The installer will need to put any config files in the proper places
- Register the NovaRenderer as a Reload Listener on the mcResourceManager thingy
- I think I'll add code to Minecraft#loadWorld(WorldClient, String) so that I can capture the chunks from the current
world. I can definitely grab entities from that. Entities look easy: I can grab all the data, wrap it in a mc_struct
thing, and send it to the native code no problemo
