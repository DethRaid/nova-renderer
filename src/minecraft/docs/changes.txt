- Removed EntityRenderer and RenderGlobal and other such from Minecraft, replaced with NovaRenderer
- Instantiate the NovaRenderer instance
- The installer will need to put any config files in the proper places
- Register the NovaRenderer as a Reload Listener on the mcResourceManager thingy
- Call the Nova Renderer to update itself, rather than RenderGlobal and EntityRenderer, in Minecraft#runTick
    - Actually, I think I want to keep some of the EntityRenderer setup code around so I don't have to rewrite things
      like calculating the fog color
- Call the Nova Renderer to render everything in Minecraft#runGameLoop
- Add EntityRenderer#getFogColorRed, #getFogColorGreen, and #getFogColorBlue to do exactly what they say on the tin
    - In order to take advantage of these, I'll have to make sure that EntityRenderer#updateFogColor gets called at some
      point
