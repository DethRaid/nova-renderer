## miniz

This is a reorganized version of miniz
https://github.com/richgel999/miniz

basically file since source file has been separated into a more traditional
header/source library. This is mainly based off of the organization done for the
version in the valve vogl tool. That way the changes could be merged more easily.

I've also integrated the changes from here:
