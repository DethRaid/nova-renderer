# How to contribute
Here's some guidelines for contributing to the Vulkan Mod

## Language Agnostic Guidelines
* Document every method you write. At a bare minimum, documentation should tell a user what a method does, what all its parameters mean, and what its return value looks like. Simple getter methods can get away without explicitly documenting what the method returns.
* Document every class you write. Class documentation should give an overview of what the class does, and should try to give some hint of how the class works within the context of the entire program.
* If you use spaces to format your code, use four spaces for each indentation block. This will ensure that all the code looks uniform.
* I don't care if you use spaces or tabs. Both C++ and Java are whitespace agnostic.
* Make sure your code compiles and runs properly before submitting it.
* Put spaces around binary operators (+, -, *, etc). This vastly improves code readability.
* Use descriptive variable names. This should go without saying, but I see plenty of code with one-letter variable names. If your variable name only has one letter, there better be a good reason for it.
 
## C++ Guidelines
* Use C++14. We're not writing C-with-classes. Take full advantage of C++'s language features.
* I use snake_case for naming methods, classes, variables, whatever. I'd prefer that you also use snake_case, but it's fine if you don't.
